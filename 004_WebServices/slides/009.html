<h1>JSON</h2>

<h2>JavaScript Object Notation</h3>
  <p>
    JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format.
    It is easy for humans to read and write.
    It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
    It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language,
    Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format
    that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are
    familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages,
    including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.
    These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
