  <h1>HTML</h1>
  <div>
    <p><strong>HyperText Markup Language:</strong>
      The content and structure of the page including titles,
      headings, text, images, menu items, et. al.
      that are marked up with tags that describe
      the different document content.
    </p>

  <p>HTML by itself is pretty bland.</p>
