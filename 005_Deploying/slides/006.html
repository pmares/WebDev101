<h3>Obfuscate</h3>
<p>To <em>Obfuscate</em> is to make unclear or unintelligible.  If you do not
  want others to easily see your JS code, or copy and re-use it, you should
  consider obfuscation.  <strong>Note:</strong> some of the best programs to obfuscate your
  code will actually increase the size rather than reduce it.
