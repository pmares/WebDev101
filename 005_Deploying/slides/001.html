<h1>Deploying code on the Web</h1>

<p>
We have been working on our Web site designs in the online playground CodePen,
or in a text editor on our local machines.  Now that we have some content prepared,
we are ready to deploy a website.
</p>
<p>
  In this class, we will go over preparing your files for deployment,
  and the process for getting your site hosted on the web.
