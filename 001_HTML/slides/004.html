<h1>HTML</h1>

<div>
  <p><strong>HyperText Markup Language:</strong>
    The content and structure of the page including titles,
    headings, text, images, menu items, et. al.
    that are marked up with tags that describe
    the different document content.
  </p>

  <p>HTML by itself is pretty bland.</p>
